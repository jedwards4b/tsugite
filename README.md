# Tsugite
## Interactive Design and Fabrication of Wood Joints

![](img/tsugite_title.png)

This is the repository related to a paper presented at UIST 2020.
It is an interface where you can model a joint geometry in a voxelized design space, and export milling paths for fabrication with a 3-axis CNC-machine.

The system performs geometric evaluations in real time and provides graphical feedback accordingly (see a-h below).

### Environment Requirements
Python 3.8.3

OpenGL 3.1.5

PyQt5 5.15.1

OpenCV 4.4.0.44

Pillow 7.2.0

numpy 1.18.5

pyrr 0.10.3

### Run Program
Run setup/tsugite_app.py

### Fabrication
Set machine origin at the center of the top side of the joint.
Insert wood bar a) vertically if the sliding/fabrication is aligned with the timber axis, and b) horizontally if it is perpendicular to the timber axis.
